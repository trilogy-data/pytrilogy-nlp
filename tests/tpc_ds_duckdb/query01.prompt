prompt = """Using store_returns info [all your fields will be subsets of store_returns], output the return customer text id and return store id for customers and how much they returned to the store the state of TN in 2000. 

Additionally add this complex filter - return only return customer text ID and store ID where the total returns by store for that customer were more than 1.2 times
the average per-cstomer total returns by store. This will require a nested calculation - first find the total returns by customer and store, then use that in a calculation of
average of total customer returns by store [and only store!], then compare the total returns you calculated to this value * 1.2. 

IMPORTANT: if you take the average by store AND customer you will get the wrong answer!!

Return at most 100 rows. Sort results by customer_text_id asc
