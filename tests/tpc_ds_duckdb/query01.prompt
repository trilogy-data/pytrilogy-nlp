prompt = """Using store_returns info, output the customer text id and store_id for customers and how much they returned to the store the state of TN in 2000. 

Additionally add this complex filter - return only customer text ID and store ID where the total returns by store for that customer were more than 1.2 times
the average total returns by customer by store. This will require a nested calculation - first find the total revenue by customer and store, then use that in a calculation of
average total revenue by store, then compare the customer revenue to this value * 1.2. 

Return at most 100 rows. Sort results by the customer text_id.
