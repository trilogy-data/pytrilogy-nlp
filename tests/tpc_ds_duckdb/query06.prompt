Using store_sales information and item database, list all the states and the customer count
for customers who bought items with a sales price that is at least 1.2 times the average sales price of all other items in the same category
in january of 2001. (tip: for the sales price filter, get the average sales price by category, multiply by 1.2, then compare to item price). Restrict rows returned to 
those with a customer count >=10! DO NOT FORGET TO FILTER TO CUSTOMER COUNT >= 10

Note that the average price filter should be based on taking the average list price across a category for all items from the item dataset and include
all items, not just those sold in stores.

Order results by the customer count asc, then the state ascending
