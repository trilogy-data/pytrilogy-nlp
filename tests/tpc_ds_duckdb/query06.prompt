times higher than the current average item price of all other items in the same category
in january of 2001. (tip: for the sales price filter, get the average item current price by category, then compare that times 1.2 against the item price to ensure the item price is higher). 

Restrict to sales in January of 2001 where the category is not null and where customer count >=10.

Order results by the customer count asc (nulls first), then the state ascending (nulls first)"""
